# About Me  
I’m a Postdoctoral Fellow at Queen’s University’s Centre for Neuroscience Studies & Ingenuity Labs Research Institute, where I develop AI pipelines for epilepsy detection and presurgical decision-making using arterial spin labeling MRI and foundational models for neurological disease prediction. I have also been a Postdoctoral Fellow in ECE & Ingenuity Labs at Queen’s since Apr 2023, working on hierarchical time-series representation learning and multi-domain EEG modeling for cognitive-load classification. From Sept 2021–Mar 2023, I was at the KNU-LG Convergence Research Center in South Korea, building Transformer-based ICU outcome predictors and AI clinical-decision support systems. I earned my PhD (with Best Thesis Award) in Electronic & Electrical Engineering from Kyungpook National University in August 2021, where I focused on low-shot, long-tailed learning for medical imaging and time-series prediction.
